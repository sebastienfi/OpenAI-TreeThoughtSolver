# OpenAI Tree-Based Problem Solver

The OpenAI Tree-Based Problem Solver is an open-source project that leverages the power of OpenAI's language models to solve problems presented in a structured format. The program uses a chained prompt technique and tree-based thought process to iteratively refine solutions to complex problems. The idea was inspired by a YouTube video and has been developed into a functional tool.

## System Requirements
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Git and Python3 installed on your local machine.
- An active OpenAI API key. This key can be found on your [OpenAI account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone git@github.com:sebastienfi/OpenAI-TreeThoughtSolver.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or better use `venv` [see here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)).
3. Provide your OpenAI API Key. Copy and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, then replace the placeholder text in this file with your actual OpenAI API Key. You can do this with the command `cp .env.example .env && code . .env`.

## Execution

1. Define your problem in the `problems.md` file. Problems should be clearly defined and structured. If you need help formulating your problem, you can use ChatGPT to help you summarize your ideas.
2. Execute the program by running the command `streamlit run main.py` in your terminal.
3. Monitor the progress of the problem-solving process through the web application's progress bar.
4. Once the execution is complete, the solution will be output to a file named `solution_<timestamp>.md`. This file contains a detailed breakdown of the problem-solving process and the final solution.

## Output and Results

The detailed results of each run are saved in the `./results` folder. This includes intermediate results from each problem-solving step. Please note that the contents of this folder are overwritten each time you execute the program, so make sure to backup any important results.

## Solution
After 3 iterations, we deepened the thoughts on the solution.

Winning Solution: Understanding the Organizational Structure and Current Projects

Potential Scenarios: One potential scenario is that you could be faced with resistance from team members or even other stakeholders. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as insecurity, territoriality, or a lack of transparency.

Implementation Strategies: To implement this solution, you can start by setting up meetings with different stakeholders, including other Tech Leads, project managers, and team members. You can also request access to all relevant project documentation to understand the current projects better.

Necessary Partnerships/Resources: You would need the cooperation of other Tech Leads, project managers, and team members to get a clear understanding of the ongoing projects. Moreover, you would need access to all the relevant project documentation.

Overcoming Obstacles: If you face resistance from team members or other stakeholders, try to address their concerns. Explain your role and how understanding the organization and projects will help in better decision-making and efficiency. If lack of transparency is the issue due to sensitive information, propose a non-disclosure agreement or similar measures to ensure data security.

Unexpected Outcomes: One unexpected outcome could be realizing that there are significant gaps or issues in the ongoing projects or the organizational structure. In such a case, instead of being overwhelmed, use it as an opportunity to propose improvements. 

Another unexpected outcome could be finding out that there is a lack of documented information about projects. In this case, you might have to spend more time in meetings and discussions to understand the projects properly.

Finally, while studying the organizational structure and current projects, you may identify potential areas for improvement or innovative solutions that hadn't been previously considered. Embrace these insights as opportunities for demonstrating leadership and initiative.
